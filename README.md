# FortuneTeller
The objective of this Python code is to predict the state of the user's future. It does this by randomly selecting an element from various arrays.
The arrays are set up so that any combination of elements will create a coherent "fortune."

My intentions for using GitHub are to expand my coding knowledge (in this case, C++) and continue building a portfolio of work to
back up my technical skill. I also would like to use this site as a Google Docs for coding, where I can interact with my classmates
on any given project while attending class remotely.
